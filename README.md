# NeReGraIn: Neural Regular Grammar Induction
This repository contains PyTorch code for the model introduced in the paper "A Neural Model for Regular Grammar Induction".  

## Dependencies
Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.11

On the side, WandB is used at times to log losses.

## Running the code
Just run `main.py` while in the project directory.
Running it will execute an example training loop, with production matrices outputted at the end.
